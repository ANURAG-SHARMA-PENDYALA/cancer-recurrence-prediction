# Hello Everyone, Welcome to my GitHub repository



Cancer recurrence prediction in thyroid cancer is my project for the University of Cincinnati Capstone Project. I utilised my Knowledge in the coursework that I've taken at UC in Machine Learning and Data Mining and Mobile Application Development. Trained and Developed a Ensemble model and created a Interactive Web Frontend to predict the cancer recurrence. 



## Outcomes of the Project:

* Successfully Implement Exploratory Data Analysis.
* Feature Refinement and Model Efficiency Improvement.
* Responsive Front-end Application.
* RESTful api development in Flask.



## How to run this project:

* Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv <environment\_name>` and install all the essential packages that are mentioned in \_\_requirements.txt\_\_ .
* Run both the .pkl files and run the flask app to interact with the model.
